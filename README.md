# GenshinToolkit

Imagine getting **SO BORED** that you reimplemented the whole Genshin Launcher in WPF

Comes with:
- Problematic code to hopefully fix your problems
- 7z and aria2
- Does not even remember your settings!

Anyway, prebuilt in [Releases](https://github.com/ohaiibuzzle/GSToolkit/releases)
